[VERSE1]

xxxxxxxx (?)

[CHORUS]
call me a moth - with no reason to die
flying to fire - why can't you see my eyes 
shining in a different spectrum of light
blink and i'm gone, i wasn't a lie
i was apart, i was so distant
too much involved in your meddling business
not really regret but I was your constant threat
I was your constant threat
I was your constant threat rou
(oh right)
are you out of breath yeah
are you out of breath
are you out of breath yeah


[VERSE2]

xxxxxxxxx

i was alive, i was so destined
turning electric 
veins on my neck symptom of anger
too much involvement meant no flex 
seeking approval is it your business
feeling uptight, couldn't care less 
i'd be your first offender (i will be your first offender)
again with the bash, can't cope 
then reach for your stash
doing what you can do get yourself in order





[CHORUS]
call me a moth - with no reason to die
flying to fire - why can't you see my eyes (oh right)
shining in a different spectrum of light
blink and i'm gone, i wasn't a lie
i was apart, i was so distant
too much involved in your meddling business
not really regret but I was your constant threat
I was your constant threat
I was your constant threat rou







you thought i was a threat
into the depths of the night i roll
what else do you want, more?
naah, you always wanted the whole
i can't or i shouldn't and i won't - so piss off
